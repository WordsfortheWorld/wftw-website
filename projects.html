        <p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Dear Queer Youth,

I want you to know you deserve to be seen, loved, and affirmed by all people, not just as an object but as a being to celebrate and define life with, and that your light and your truth deserve to be melded with and danced with by the sparks of light in every other human being, not defined away because it makes people scared of what experiences, loves, and dreams they might be swept away in a shining helix of petals interwoven if they allowed themselves to human. Stay hydrated and nurture the most ornate and perfect definition of yourself, and remember that one day you will find a place to release and share these wonders. 
           
Take care,
***
        </p><hr style="width:90%"><br>

        <p style="white-space:pre-wrap">The beginning of a message, at least for the one writing it, makes you vulnerable. I'm not sure how or when or where these words will find you, and unlike other ways of talking to someone I don't know whos reading this. That's not to say this letter is impersonal, because in a lot of ways it at least feels as though being queer in this current world cannot be separated from who we are. It has not been for many, many years and for many, many people. Sometimes that realization feels pungent and immovable, sometimes it's freeing and human. Sometimes it's just part of who we are and then it's everything, and then it starts again or falls apart, now it's breathtaking, and now I don't know how to describe it. It's hard for me to convey.

I wish writing a letter could be the same as hearing someone laugh, or hugging them close, or being side by side, or breaking down and crying, or realizing someone is different than the person you thought they were a moment ago.

Despite that limitation, I'm writing this letter because I think being queer can be messy and unclear and unexplainable. Im still figuring this out and maybe you are too. It could hurt and you may lose things- people, relationships, opportunities. It could be joyous and you gain all those things and then some. It could be the most boring and normal thing. Regardless of how it comes about, I'm glad we're going through it through together, wherever you are.
            </p><hr style="width:90%"><br>

            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Dear Queer Youth,

Life is a beautiful thing and so I want you to live as unapologetically yourself as possible—you deserve that. You deserve to love as your heart tells you to, be heard, and express your emotions. You are allowed to smile, laugh, and cry. Your feelings deserve to be validated. But I know life also doesn't always make this easy. There is cruelty and judgment, and I am so very sorry for that.

Despite this, I still want you to know that there are people out there who support you. There are people who appreciate you. Accept you. There are other queer, folks, allies, accomplices, etc. who will see you for the person you are. I write this letter as a straight ally still and always growing. I am still educating myself and learning to celebrate queerness. I know I'm not perfect, but I'm willing to keep trying. 

When I point out all the good, I'm not telling you to be content with a world that is only a glass half-full. No, the world must change. We owe that to you and every queer being out there. But I hope you take solace in the good when life gets tough. I hope that remembering the good will keep you going as we work to dismantle judgment one-by-one. 

All the best,
Anonymous

            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap">Dear Queer Youth,

Things probably seem really scary right now. I mean, things are very scary. I'm not going to tell you that it's not as bad as it seems - I'm sure we've all had enough of that to last a lifetime.

What I'm here to tell you is that there are good things, too. For every judgemental look, there's an appreciative one. For every bigot on the street yelling into your face, there's a teenager standing behind you in the grocery line, tapping you on the shoulder to shyly tell you they like your nonbinary pin. For every hate group, there's a queer affinity group waiting for a new member. There are people out there who will see you, all of you, and welcome it with open arms. 

What I'm here to tell you is that you aren't alone. What I'm telling you is that we are here, fighting. What I'm telling you is that it is worth it to fight. To challenge. To take up space. To exist as your truest self, even if that self doesn't fit into the image of what you're “supposed” to be, what your life is “supposed” to look like. Even if you have to tread off not just the beaten path but all paths, to journey out into the wild open expanse, and find: you.

You aren't the first person to take this journey. You won't be the last. And most importantly, there are others taking it with you. Kindred spirits, all winding through the chaos of their lives and trying to chase their happiness - some have just started; others have been on this not-path for a long, long time. But all of them started out like you, small and unsure and scared. And they love you. We love you. I love you.

I hope you find love and light on your journey, whether our paths cross again or not. And I hope this letter has given you something to hold with you on the long road ahead.

With Love and Support,
              
Mikah
